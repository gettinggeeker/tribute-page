                <p><b>Here's a time line of Ada Lovelace's life:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</li>
                    <li>Lord Byron expected his child to be a "glorious boy" and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl. The child was named after Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called "Ada" by Byron himself.</li>
                    <li>She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.</li>
                    <li>As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the first computer programmers.</li>                    
                    <li>On 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. They had 3 children.</li>
                    <li>Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the calculating engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.</li>
                    <li>She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of "poetical science" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.</li>
                    <li>Lovelace died at the age of 36 – the same age at which her father had died – on 27 November 1852</li>
